Detailed step-by-step breakdown of each section and what it represents:

Top Header with Filters and Total Metrics:

**Month Selector:** Allows the user to select the month for which they want to view sales data. Currently set to April 2023.

**Total Sales:** $119K in total sales for the month, showing a 20.3% increase compared to the last month (LM) and a 24.1% increase year-over-year (YoY).

**Total Orders:** 25,335 total orders placed, up 19.3% from LM and 4.1% from last year.

**Total Quantity Sold:** 36,469 units sold, indicating a 19.9% increase from LM and 1.6% from last year.

**Sales Trend Over the Period:**
A bar chart showing daily sales throughout April, with each bar representing a day. Days are shaded differently for weekends and weekdays. Tooltips likely provide precise sales figures and comparison to previous periods when hovered over each bar.

**Sales by Weekday/Weekend:**
A donut chart displaying sales distribution between weekdays ($80K) and weekends ($39K), with weekends accounting for 33.08% of total sales.

**Sales by Product Category:**
A breakdown of sales by different product categories such as Coffee, Tea, Bakery, and others. Each category shows the total sales amount and the percentage change from the previous month.

**Sales by Product (Top 10):**
A detailed list of the top 10 selling products, each with the total sales amount and percentage growth. For example, Barista Espresso leads with $15.6K in sales, showing an 18.9% increase.

**Sales by Store Location:**
Sales figures segmented by store locations such as Hellâ€™s Kitchen, Astoria, and Lower Manhattan, with each location's sales total and percentage growth compared to LM.

**Sales by Days/Hours:**
A heatmap or table showing sales for each hour of each day of the week. This indicates peak sales times and helps in planning for staffing and stock.

**Tooltip Usage:**
using tooltips for providing full information, which likely means when users hover over any data point (like bars in the sales trend chart, segments in the donut chart, or product names in the top 10 list), a tooltip appears providing more detailed data such as exact numbers, comparisons to previous periods, or other relevant details.

**DashBoard:**
This dashboard effectively combines various visual elements like bar charts, donut charts, and tables to provide a clear, comprehensive view of sales performance across multiple dimensions. The use of color and the logical arrangement of information help in quick analysis and decision-making.
